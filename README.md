This project will read data from a file of tags called tags.csv, and sort them from the lowest to highest count they occured in the csv file. It will also allow users to search for induvidual tags by their count or name. 

Search used - Linear search to find the highest and lowest count easily. 

Sort used - Insertion sort is used since it uses less memory allocation and works efficiently with my code.

My total run time of the code to give the sorted output of movie tags is less than 2 minutes.

I have made total 3 files - MovieTags.java, TagList.java, Tag.java
